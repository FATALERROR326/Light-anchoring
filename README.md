# Light-anchoring
697SD UMass Amherst 2021 FALL



## Motivation
--------
As we noticed this Light-anchoring technology have some advantages over QR code, we saw the world-changing potential on it. As a result, we are going to work it out.

## Design Goals
--------
Create a light-based anchor to precisely overlay content on smartphone screen.
To implement all the anchoring functions, and to explore more features of as much as possible.

## Deliverables
--------
Implement hardware prototype for LED encoding
Receive LED encoded patterns on smartphone camera and decode the pattern (encoder ID)
Precisely overlay encoder ID on smartphone screen

## System Blocks
--------
Hardware:
Software:

## HW/SW requirements
--------
Hardware:LEDs, microcontroller (BLE), smartphone
Software:
